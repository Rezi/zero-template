# Tailwind → Panda CSS: Leftover Audit & Finalization Plan

Audit of `libs/ui-library` (55 components + their `.stories.tsx`) for residual Tailwind
usage after the Panda migration, plus an analysis of the `/`-opacity (transparency)
color handling and a plan to finish the transition.

> **Update:** the literal Tailwind classes in the story files have been migrated to Panda
> `css()` (all 6 stories: direction, card, button, badge, alert, tabs). That item is done
> and has been dropped from the list below.

**TL;DR** — the component *style objects* are migrated cleanly to Panda `css()`. What
remains tied to Tailwind is essentially three things:

1. ~~**Enter/exit animation classes** from `tw-animate-css` (13 components)~~ — ✅ done (§1).
2. ~~**Named `group-*/peer-*` Tailwind variants** still written as raw class strings
   (mainly `navigation-menu.tsx` and `calendar.tsx`)~~ — ✅ done (§2).
3. **The global Tailwind CSS layer** (`apps/zero-app/src/styles.css`) — `@import
   "tailwindcss"`, `tw-animate-css`, `@theme`, `@apply` — plus the runtime deps
   (`tailwindcss`, `tw-animate-css`, `tailwind-merge`). **← the remaining work (§3/§6).**

Everything else flagged by a naive grep (`group`/`peer` markers, `role="group"`,
sonner's `toaster`/`cn-toast`) is **not** a Tailwind dependency — see §4.

## 1. Animation classes from `tw-animate-css` (highest priority)

> **Update (done):** Phases 0–2 are complete. **All 13 components** below are migrated and
> struck through. `navigation-menu.tsx` was finished as part of §2: its `data-[motion=…]` and
> `group-data-[viewport=false]/navigation-menu:*` clusters turned out to be **dead code** (Base UI
> emits neither `data-motion` nor `data-viewport`; the real content motion is already handled by
> `data-activation-direction` + starting/ending-style in `navigationMenuContentStyles`, and the
> popup chrome by `navigationMenuPopupStyles`), so they were deleted.
>
> **Pattern note (important):** this app is on **Base UI**, not Radix. Base UI drives enter/exit
> via **CSS transitions** keyed on `data-starting-style`/`data-ending-style` (the resting style is
> the open state; the hidden state goes under those attributes), NOT keyframe `animation`s keyed on
> `data-open`/`data-closed`. The shared style objects live in `libs/ui-library/src/lib/animations.ts`
> (`overlayAnimationStyles`, `contentAnimationStyles`, `popoverAnimationStyles`,
> `tooltipAnimationStyles`, `selectAnimationStyles`) and follow `sheet.tsx`'s established idiom. A
> first attempt used `@keyframes enter/exit` + `data-open`/`data-closed` (a faithful `tw-animate-css`
> port) but the backdrop stayed static — Base UI doesn't reliably run those keyframes on a portalled
> backdrop. `panda.config.mjs` keyframes are now only `accordionDown`/`accordionUp` + `caretBlink`
> (accordion + caret legitimately need keyframes); `drawer` relies on `vaul`'s own injected overlay fade.

These are Tailwind/`tw-animate-css` utility strings passed as `className` (usually as a
sibling of a Panda `css()` result inside `cn(...)`). They depend on both
`@import "tailwindcss"` and `@import "tw-animate-css"` being active. ~~Panda currently has
**no** keyframes/animation tokens defined (`grep` of `panda.config.mjs` → none), so these
cannot be dropped until equivalents are added to Panda.~~ (Keyframes now defined — see Update.)

Tokens involved: `data-open:animate-in`, `data-closed:animate-out`, `fade-in-0`,
`fade-out-0`, `zoom-in-95`, `zoom-out-95`, `slide-in-from-{top,bottom,left,right}-2`,
`slide-out-to-*`, `animate-accordion-down`, `animate-accordion-up`,
`animate-caret-blink`, `duration-100/300/1000`.

| Component | Location (approx) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ ~~`accordion.tsx`~~ | :123 | ~~`data-open:animate-accordion-down data-closed:animate-accordion-up`~~ → `accordionDown`/`accordionUp` keyframes in `accordionContentPanelStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`alert-dialog.tsx`~~ | :111, :113 | ~~overlay + content fade/zoom~~ → `overlayAnimationStyles` + `contentAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`combobox.tsx`~~ | :51 | ~~popover slide/fade/zoom~~ → `popoverAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`context-menu.tsx`~~ | :35 | ~~popover slide/fade/zoom~~ → `popoverAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`dialog.tsx`~~ | :73, :75 | ~~overlay + content~~ → `overlayAnimationStyles` + `contentAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`drawer.tsx`~~ | :21 | ~~fade~~ → removed; `vaul` injects its own overlay fade |
| ✅ ~~`dropdown-menu.tsx`~~ | :33 | ~~slide/fade/zoom (+ `data-closed:overflow-hidden`)~~ → `popoverAnimationStyles` + local `data-closed` overflow |
| ✅ ~~`hover-card.tsx`~~ | :31 | ~~slide/fade/zoom~~ → `popoverAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`input-otp.tsx`~~ | :119 | ~~`animate-caret-blink duration-1000`~~ → `caretBlink` keyframe in `inputOTPCaretStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`navigation-menu.tsx`~~ | :153, :299 | ~~motion slide + viewport block~~ → deleted (dead code; see §2). Real motion already in `navigationMenuContentStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`popover.tsx`~~ | :33 | ~~slide/fade/zoom~~ → `popoverAnimationStyles` |
| ✅ ~~`select.tsx`~~ | :76 | ~~slide/fade/zoom (+ `data-[align-trigger=true]:animate-none`)~~ → `selectAnimationStyles` (motion scoped to `data-align-trigger='false'`) |
| ✅ ~~`tooltip.tsx`~~ | :33 | ~~slide/fade/zoom~~ → `tooltipAnimationStyles` (150ms + `delayed-open`) |

**13 files — all done.** 11 follow the shadcn enter/exit pattern, covered by the shared
`animations.ts` style objects; `accordion` and `input-otp` got their own keyframes
(`accordionDown/Up`, `caretBlink`); `navigation-menu`'s animation strings were dead code and
were deleted (its real motion was already migrated).

---

## 2. Named `group-*` / `peer-*` Tailwind variants (raw strings) — ✅ DONE

The migration already converted *most* group/peer relationships into Panda selectors
(e.g. `label.tsx`: `".peer:disabled ~ &"`, `".group[data-disabled='true'] &"`). The
remaining raw Tailwind variant strings are now migrated:

- **`navigation-menu.tsx`**
  - ~~`:127` — `transition duration-300 group-data-popup-open/navigation-menu-trigger:rotate-180 …`~~
    → folded into `navigationMenuTriggerIconStyles` as
    `"[data-slot='navigation-menu-trigger'][data-popup-open] &": { rotate: "180deg" }` +
    `transitionProperty: "rotate"`. (This also **fixed a latent bug**: the original referenced the
    named group `group/navigation-menu-trigger`, but the trigger was only marked `"group"`, so the
    rotate never fired.)
  - ~~`:153` — the large `group-data-[viewport=false]/navigation-menu:*` block~~ → **deleted as
    dead code** (Base UI emits no `data-viewport`/`data-motion`; popup chrome already on
    `navigationMenuPopupStyles`, motion already on `navigationMenuContentStyles`). The
    `group/navigation-menu` marker on Root was removed with it.
  - ~~`:299` — indicator `data-[state=hidden|visible]` fade~~ → deleted (Base UI sets no
    `data-state` here; `NavigationMenuPrimitive.Icon` exposes no transition hook, so the classes
    were inert).
- **`calendar.tsx`**
  - ~~`:337` — `group-data-[focused=true]/day:border-ring … :ring-[3px] :ring-ring/50`~~ → folded
    into the day-button `css()` as `".group\\/day[data-focused='true'] &": { borderColor: "ring",
    ringW: "3", ringC: "ring/50" }` (native `/50` opacity; `position`/`z-index` already in the base).

The *marker* side (`"group/day"`, `"group/calendar"`, `"group"` on the nav list/trigger, …) is
just a plain class name and is fine to keep — Panda selectors target `.group\/day` etc. Verified:
the escaped-slash selector and the `data-popup-open` ancestor selector both generate correctly;
`tsc` clean; the §2 grep gate (`group-data`/`peer-data`) returns only a comment in `label.tsx`.

---

## 3. Global Tailwind layer & dependencies

**`apps/zero-app/src/styles.css`** (also imported by Storybook's `preview.tsx`):

- `@import "tailwindcss";` — the Tailwind engine.
- `@import "tw-animate-css";` — keyframes for §1.
- `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css";` — shadcn base.
- `@source "../../../libs/ui-library/src";` / `@source ".../zero-app-components/src"` — Tailwind content scanning.
- `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));` — Tailwind dark variant.
- `@theme inline { --color-*, --radius-*, --font-sans }` — **duplicates** the token
  mapping already mirrored in `panda.config.mjs` `semanticTokens`. The `:root` / `.dark`
  CSS variable definitions below it are the source of truth and must be **kept** (Panda
  tokens reference them via `var(--…)`).
- `@layer base { * { @apply border-border outline-ring/50; } body { @apply bg-background text-foreground; } }` — Tailwind `@apply`; needs to move to Panda `globalCss`.

**`@tailwindcss/vite`** is also wired into Storybook (`.storybook/main.ts:14-16`) and the
app's Vite config.

**Runtime deps (`package.json`):** `tailwindcss ^4.1.18`, `tw-animate-css ^1.4.0`,
`tailwind-merge ^3.6.0`. `clsx ^2.1.1` is fine to keep.

**`cn()` (`lib/utils.ts`)** = `twMerge(clsx(inputs))`. `twMerge` is meaningful only while
Tailwind classes coexist with Panda output; once Tailwind is gone it does nothing useful
for Panda's atomic classes (and could in theory mis-merge them). Plan to swap to plain
`clsx` or Panda's `cx` at the end (see Phase 4).

---

## 4. NOT Tailwind leftovers (false positives — leave alone)

- `"group"`, `"peer"`, `"group/<name>"` **bare markers** — plain class names targeted by
  Panda selectors. No Tailwind needed.
- `sonner.tsx`: `className="toaster group"` and `toast: "cn-toast"` — sonner's own marker
  classes referenced by sonner's CSS / app overrides, **not** Tailwind.
- `role="group"`, `data-sidebar="group"`, `data-slot="…"` — HTML attributes, not classes.
- All the `display: "flex"`, `position: "relative"`, `inline-flex`, `flex-start`, etc.
  hits are **Panda `css()` property values**, already migrated.

---

## 5. Transparency colors (`/<opacity>`) — analysis & abstraction

### What actually needs special handling

There are ~70 `"<token>/<number>"` opacity usages across the library (`bg: "input/50"`,
`color: "foreground/60"`, `bg: "black/30"`, `borderColor: "destructive/50"`,
`stroke: "border/50"`, `bg: "muted.foreground/10"`, `bg: "sidebar.foreground/70"`, …).

**Panda handles the `/<opacity>` modifier natively for all *built-in* color utilities.**
Verified in the generated CSS (`styled-system/styles.css`):

```
--mix-background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--colors-input) 50%, transparent);
--mix-color:      color-mix(in srgb, var(--colors-foreground) 60%, transparent);
--mix-borderColor:color-mix(in srgb, var(--colors-red-500) 40%, transparent);
```

So `bg`, `color`, `borderColor`, `stroke`, `fill`, `outlineColor`, … all work with **zero
custom code**. No action needed for any of these.

### Why `ringC` is special

`ringC` is a **custom** utility (`values: "colors"`). Panda does **not** apply the
`/<opacity>` modifier to custom-utility values — it passes the raw string (`"ring/30"`)
straight through. That is the *only* reason `panda.config.mjs` reproduces `color-mix` by
hand in `ringC.transform`. It is the **single** custom color utility in the project, so
the pattern is not yet reused anywhere.

### Inconsistency to resolve

- Panda's native modifier emits `color-mix(in srgb, …)`.
- `ringC` emits `color-mix(in oklab, …)`.

These blend slightly differently. For a coherent design system, pick one color space.
(Panda's default is `srgb`; the original Tailwind ring used `oklab`.) Recommendation:
align `ringC` to `srgb` to match every other opacity color in the app — unless the
oklab ring blend is intentional, in which case add a one-line note.

### Proposed abstraction

Even though only `ringC` needs it today, the slash-parsing logic should be extracted so
any future custom color utility can reuse it (and so the color space is defined once):

```js
// panda.config.mjs
// Reproduces Panda's native `/<opacity>` color modifier for *custom* color utilities
// (Panda only auto-applies it to built-in color utilities). `srgb` matches the color
// space Panda uses for built-in utilities so custom + built-in opacities blend identically.
function colorWithAlpha(value, colorSpace = "srgb") {
  if (typeof value !== "string") return value;
  const slash = value.indexOf("/");
  if (slash === -1) return value; // bare token or raw value — caller resolves
  const token = value.slice(0, slash).replace(/\./g, "-");
  const pct = value.slice(slash + 1);
  return `color-mix(in ${colorSpace}, var(--colors-${token}) ${pct}%, transparent)`;
}
```

Then `ringC.transform` collapses to:

```js
ringC: {
  className: "ring-c",
  values: "colors",
  transform(value) {
    const slash = typeof value === "string" ? value.indexOf("/") : -1;
    return {
      "--ring-shadow-color":
        slash !== -1 ? colorWithAlpha(value) : value,
    };
  },
},
```

This keeps the behavior, removes the inline duplication, fixes the srgb/oklab mismatch,
and gives a single reusable helper for any future custom utility (e.g. a custom shadow or
gradient-stop color).

## 6. Finalization plan

Ordered so the app stays working after every phase. Storybook + the app both pull
`apps/zero-app/src/styles.css`, so Tailwind can only be removed once **all** of §1–§2 are
migrated.

### ✅ Phase 0 — Panda animation foundation (unblocks §1) — DONE
- `theme.extend.keyframes` in `panda.config.mjs` = `accordionDown`, `accordionUp`, `caretBlink`
  (the only cases that genuinely need keyframes). The Base UI enter/exit motion does NOT use
  keyframes — see the pattern note in §1.
- Shared style objects in `libs/ui-library/src/lib/animations.ts` (`overlayAnimationStyles`,
  `contentAnimationStyles`, `popoverAnimationStyles`, `tooltipAnimationStyles`,
  `selectAnimationStyles`) — CSS transitions keyed on `data-starting-style`/`data-ending-style`,
  following `sheet.tsx`.
- Verify in Storybook against the existing `tw-animate-css` output before removing it.
  (`tw-animate-css` is still imported, so the two can be diffed side-by-side before Phase 4.)

### ✅ Phase 1 — Migrate the animation components (§1) — DONE (except `navigation-menu`)
- ~~Replace each animation class string with the Phase-0 Panda equivalent, expressed in the
  component's existing `css()` object via `data-open`/`data-closed`/`data-[side=…]`
  selectors~~ — done for the 12 components struck through in the §1 table.
- ~~Do `accordion` and `input-otp` (caret) individually.~~ Done.
- `navigation-menu.tsx` deferred to **Phase 2** (its animation is entangled with the
  `group-data-[viewport=false]/navigation-menu:*` selectors).
- Typecheck passes (`tsc --noEmit -p libs/ui-library/tsconfig.json` → 0 errors); `deno task
  panda` regenerates the keyframes into `styled-system/styles.css`.

### ✅ Phase 2 — Migrate named group/peer variants (§2) — DONE
- `navigation-menu.tsx`: chevron rotate → `data-popup-open` ancestor selector (fixed a latent
  bug); the `data-[motion=…]` + `group-data-[viewport=false]/navigation-menu:*` clusters and the
  indicator `data-[state=…]` fade were **dead code** (Base UI emits none of those attributes) and
  were deleted.
- `calendar.tsx`: `:337` focus ring → `.group\/day[data-focused='true'] &` with `ringW`/`ringC`
  + native `/50` opacity.
- Verified: `deno task panda` regenerates the escaped-slash + ancestor selectors correctly; `tsc`
  0 errors; oxlint clean; §2 grep gate clean (only a `label.tsx` comment).

### Phase 3 — Move the global layer into Panda
- Recreate `* { borderColor; outlineColor }` and `body { bg; color }` via Panda
  `globalCss` in `panda.config.mjs`.
- Confirm `@theme inline` is fully redundant with `semanticTokens` (it is) and drop it;
  **keep** the `:root` / `.dark` CSS-variable blocks (Panda tokens depend on them).
- Apply the §5 `colorWithAlpha` refactor + resolve srgb/oklab.

### Phase 4 — Remove Tailwind
- Delete `@import "tailwindcss"`, `tw-animate-css`, `shadcn/tailwind.css`, `@source`,
  `@custom-variant dark` from `styles.css`. (Dark mode is already handled by `.dark` CSS
  vars; no Panda `_dark` condition needed for tokens.)
- Remove `@tailwindcss/vite` from `.storybook/main.ts` and the app Vite config.
- Drop `tailwindcss`, `tw-animate-css`, `tailwind-merge` from `package.json`.
- Replace `cn()` internals: `twMerge(clsx(...))` → `clsx(...)` (or Panda `cx`). Keep the
  `cn` name so call-sites are untouched. Validate that later args still override earlier
  ones acceptably for the few places that rely on it.
- Enable Panda `preflight: true` (currently `false` to avoid double reset) and re-check
  the app + Storybook for reset regressions.

### Phase 5 — Verify
- `deno task panda` (regenerate styled-system), typecheck, run Storybook, visually diff
  the animated components (dialogs, popovers, accordion, OTP caret, nav-menu, calendar).
- Grep gate (should return nothing in `libs/ui-library/src` except sonner markers):
  `grep -rnE '(animate-in|animate-out|fade-in|zoom-in|slide-in-from|animate-accordion|animate-caret|group-data|peer-data|@apply|@tailwind)' libs/ui-library/src`

### Effort snapshot
| Phase | Scope | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| ~~0~~ ✅ | ~~config keyframes~~ done | low (additive) |
| ~~1~~ ✅ | ~~13~~ 13 components done | medium (visual parity) |
| ~~2~~ ✅ | ~~2 components (`navigation-menu` + `calendar`)~~ done | medium (complex selectors) |
| 3 | global css + config | medium |
| 4 | deps/build/`cn` | medium (build + reset) |
| 5 | verification | — |

### Done
- **Story literals → Panda `css()`** — all 6 stories (direction, card, button, badge,
  alert, tabs) migrated; typecheck passes and no `className="…"` Tailwind literals remain
  in any `.stories.tsx`.
- **Phase 0 — Panda animation foundation** — `accordionDown`, `accordionUp`, `caretBlink`
  keyframes in `panda.config.mjs`; shared transition-based animation style objects (Base UI
  `data-starting-style`/`data-ending-style` idiom, per `sheet.tsx`) in
  `libs/ui-library/src/lib/animations.ts`.
- **Phase 1 — animation components (§1)** — 12 of 13 components migrated off
  `tw-animate-css` to Panda (`accordion`, `alert-dialog`, `combobox`, `context-menu`,
  `dialog`, `drawer`, `dropdown-menu`, `hover-card`, `input-otp`, `popover`, `select`,
  `tooltip`). Typecheck clean.
- **Phase 2 — named group/peer variants (§2)** — `navigation-menu.tsx` (chevron rotate →
  `data-popup-open` ancestor selector; dead `data-motion`/`data-viewport`/`data-state` clusters
  deleted) and `calendar.tsx` (`group/day` focus ring → escaped-slash ancestor selector +
  `ringW`/`ringC`). §1 + §2 grep gate now clean. Remaining: §3 (global Tailwind layer →
  `globalCss` + the `colorWithAlpha` refactor) and §4 (remove Tailwind deps / `cn` swap).
